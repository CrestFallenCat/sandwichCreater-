            What on earth is SANDWICH.INC
          </h2>
          <p>
            Imagine the most crisp, not brown lettuce, a succulent pickle or
            even the most playful tomato, then lower your expectations by just a
            few percentiles, THAT is how it feels to indulge in any SANDWICH.INC
            product (we promise!)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While wandering the Himalayas somewhere on the border of Nepal... it
            came to me, sandwiches. And there, our Company was conceived...
            literally just like that.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As well as being a free and original thinker, i'm also a businessman
            and philanthropist, so if you buy two sandwiches a penny will be
            sent towards an unspecified charity, thanks.
