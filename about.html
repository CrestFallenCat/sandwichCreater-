          Imagine the most crisp, not brown lettuce, a succulent pickle or even
          the most playful tomato, then lower your expectations by just a few
          percentiles, THAT is how it feels to indulge in any SANDWICH.INC
          product (we promise!)
        </p>
        <p>
          While wandering the Himalayas somewhere on the border of Nepal... it
          came to me, sandwiches. And there, our Company was conceived...
          literally just like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as being a free and original thinker, i'm also a businessman
          and philanthropist, so if you buy two sandwiches a penny will be sent
          towards an unspecified charity, thanks.
