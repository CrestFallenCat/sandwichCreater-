      <h2>These are not just sandwiches</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine the most crisp, not brown lettuce, a succulent pickle or even
        the most playful tomato, then lower your expectations by just a few
        percentiles, THAT is how it feels to indulge in any SANDWICH.INC product
        (we promise!)
      </p>

      <p>
        While wandering the Himalayas somewhere on the border of Nepal... it
        came to me, sandwiches. And there, our Company was conceived...
        literally just like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as being a free and original thinker, i'm also a businessman and
        philanthropist, so if you buy two sandwiches a penny will be sent
        towards an unspecified charity, thanks.
      </p>
